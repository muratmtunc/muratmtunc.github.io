Many NFT platforms accommodate resale royalty which pays back the creator a predetermined percentage of the proceeds from future resales of the digital asset. The adoption of resale royalty is seemingly beneficial for NFT creators as it generates a recurring source of income. However, this may have unintended consequences on the sales price and the liquidity of the underlying NFT, which, in turn, affect commission revenue for the platform. In this paper, we focus on understanding the antecedents as well as the consequences of resale royalty. Specifically, we investigate the impact of minting cost on royalty rate, as well as the impact of resale royalty on primary market sales price and liquidity. Our identification strategy leverages a policy change that eliminated upfront minting fees for creators in a prominent NFT marketplace. We find that NFT creators reduce royalty rate when they mint an NFT without incurring a minting cost. Furthermore, we observe that a higher royalty rate can lower primary market sales prices, decrease the sale likelihood, and increase the time to sale. These results suggest that resale royalty may not necessarily benefit NFT creators. Surprisingly, the presence of resale royalty impairs market liquidity, despite reduced sales prices. Our work provides immediate implications to creators and platforms when leveraging resale royalty in NFT marketplaces.","tags":null,"title":"Resale Royalty in NFT Marketplaces: Implications for Creators and Platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655989200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655989200,"objectID":"d70768a92636aef12a6faf31e6771ab7","permalink":"https://muratmtunc.github.io/talk/how-do-platform-subsidies-affect-creation-engagement-and-pricing-evidence-from-non-fungible-tokens/","publishdate":"2022-06-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/how-do-platform-subsidies-affect-creation-engagement-and-pricing-evidence-from-non-fungible-tokens/","section":"event","summary":"Content creation costs pose a threat for online marketplaces aiming to attract new users.

While some platforms provide a single overall rating for product quality (also referred to as single-dimensional rating scheme), others provide a separate rating for each individual quality attribute (also referred to as multi-dimensional rating scheme). A multi-dimensional rating scheme is superior to a single-dimensional rating scheme, ceteris paribus, in reducing consumers' uncertainty about product quality and value.  However, we show that, when sellers respond to product ratings by adjusting their prices, compared to the single-dimensional rating scheme, the multi-dimensional rating scheme does not always benefit consumers, nor does it necessarily benefit the sellers or the society. The uncertainty associated with quality attribute rating and the extent of differentiation between competing products determine whether a finer-grained multi-dimensional rating scheme is superior to the coarser-grained single-dimensional rating scheme from the consumers', sellers' or a social planner's perspective. The main driver of the results is that the more (less) granular and less (more) uncertain information exposes (hides) underlying differentiation, or lack of it, between competing products, which, in turn, alters the upstream price competition in the presence of heterogeneous consumer preferences. The results demonstrate that focusing on the information transfer aspect of rating schemes provides only a partial understanding of the true impacts of rating schemes.","tags":null,"title":"Online Product Reviews: Is a Finer-Grained Rating Scheme Superior to a Coarser One?","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1634994000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634994000,"objectID":"cadc7befc3c9c9da1cfd4fccdf02d4e5","permalink":"https://muratmtunc.github.io/talk/impact-of-resale-royalty-on-sale-prices-and-market-liquidity-in-the-nft-marketplace/","publishdate":"2022-09-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/impact-of-resale-royalty-on-sale-prices-and-market-liquidity-in-the-nft-marketplace/","section":"event","summary":"Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces facilitate users to mint and trade digital assets such as collectibles, trading cards, and digital artwork. Many NFT platforms accommodate resale royalty which pays back the creator a predetermined percentage of the proceeds from future resales of the digital asset. The adoption of resale royalty is seemingly beneficial for NFT creators as it generates a recurring source of income. However, this may have unintended consequences on the sales price and the liquidity of the underlying NFT, which, in turn, affect commission revenue for the platform. In this paper, we focus on understanding the antecedents as well as the consequences of resale royalty. Specifically, we investigate the impact of minting cost on royalty rate, as well as the impact of resale royalty on primary market sales price and liquidity. Our identification strategy leverages a policy change that eliminated upfront minting fees for creators in a prominent NFT marketplace. We find that NFT creators reduce royalty rate when they mint an NFT without incurring a minting cost. Furthermore, we observe that a higher royalty rate can lower primary market sales prices, decrease the sale likelihood, and increase the time to sale. These results suggest that resale royalty may not necessarily benefit NFT creators. Surprisingly, the presence of resale royalty impairs market liquidity, despite reduced sales prices. Our work provides immediate implications to creators and platforms when leveraging resale royalty in NFT marketplaces.","tags":[],"title":"Impact of Resale Royalty on Sale Prices and Market Liquidity in the NFT Marketplace","type":"event"},{"authors":["Murat M.

Unlike the more prevalent unilateral review scheme in which only consumers rate providers, many sharing economy platforms use a bilateral review scheme in which both consumers and providers rate each other to reduce the information asymmetry on both sides of the market and to facilitate superior matches. However, we show that the bilateral review scheme does not necessarily lead to a higher social welfare than either the unilateral review scheme or the no review scheme.  If the proportion of the low-cost consumers is less than a threshold, consumers are better off, the platform is worse off, and the providers are worse off under the bilateral review scheme than the unilateral review scheme. The key driver for these results is that the price competition between providers for the low-cost consumers can be fundamentally different under the different review schemes; the price competition affects the consumer preference for a provider and hence the match between consumers and providers, which ultimately determines the payoffs to participants and the social welfare.

While some platforms provide a single overall rating for product quality (also referred to as single-dimensional rating scheme), others provide a separate rating for each individual quality attribute (also referred to as multi-dimensional rating scheme). A multi-dimensional rating scheme is superior to a single-dimensional rating scheme, ceteris paribus, in reducing consumers' uncertainty about product quality and value.  However, we show that, when sellers respond to product ratings by adjusting their prices, compared to the single-dimensional rating scheme, the multi-dimensional rating scheme does not always benefit consumers, nor does it necessarily benefit the sellers or the society. The uncertainty associated with quality attribute rating and the extent of differentiation between competing products determine whether a finer-grained multi-dimensional rating scheme is superior to the coarser-grained single-dimensional rating scheme from the consumers', sellers' or a social planner's perspective.
