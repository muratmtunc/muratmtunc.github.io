A multi-dimensional rating scheme is superior to a single-dimensional rating scheme, ceteris paribus, in reducing consumers' uncertainty about product quality and value.

If the proportion of the low-cost consumers is less than a threshold, consumers are better off, the platform is worse off, and the providers are worse off under the bilateral review scheme than the unilateral review scheme. The key driver for these results is that the price competition between providers for the low-cost consumers can be fundamentally different under the different review schemes; the price competition affects the consumer preference for a provider and hence the match between consumers and providers, which ultimately determines the payoffs to participants and the social welfare.

You can enable this feature by toggling the `math` option in your `config/_default/params.toml` file.\rTo render *inline* or *block* math, wrap your LaTeX math with `$...$` or `$$...$$`, respectively.\rExample **math block**:\r```latex\r$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}\r{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$\r```\rrenders as\r$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$\rExample **inline math** `$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$` renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\rExample **multi-line math** using the `\\\\\\\\` math linebreak:\r```latex\r$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026 \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\\r1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026 \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\r```\rrenders as\r$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026 \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\\r1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026 \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\r### Diagrams\rAcademic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams.
