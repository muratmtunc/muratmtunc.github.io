None. myInteger function does not return a value.\n 6: What does the following program print on the console?\ndef myInteger (string, number):\rprint(string + number)\rmyPrint(5, 14)\r Click here to see the answer. 19\n 7: What does the following program print on the console?\ndef myInteger (string, number):\rprint(string, number)\rmyPrint(5, 14)\r Click here to see the answer. 5 14\n 8: What does the following program print on the console?\ndef myInteger (string, number):\rprint(string + number)\rmyPrint(\u0026quot;5\u0026quot;, 14)\r Click here to see the answer. Error. \u0026ldquo;5\u0026rdquo; + 14 is a syntax error, since \u0026ldquo;5\u0026rdquo; is text (i.e. string) whereas 14 is a number\n 9: Is the following code OK (i.e., runs without error) ?\ndef mySum (num1):\rnum1 += 2\rnum2 += 5\rreturn num1 + num2\rvalue = mySum (10, 2)\r Click here to see the answer. Error, num 2 is not defined in the function header.\n 10: Is the following code OK (i.e., runs without error) ?\ndef mySum (num1):\rnum1 += 2\rnum2 += 5\rreturn num1 + num2\rnum1 += 10\rvalue = mySum (10, 2)\r Click here to see the answer. It is OK, runs without error. However, there is an unreachable code after return. The function terminates after return, so please do not write any statement after return.\n 11: Is the following code OK (i.e., runs without error) ?\ndef mySum (num1, num2):\rnum1 += 2\rnum2 += 5\rreturn num1 + num2\rnum1 += 10\rreturn num1 + num2\rvalue = mySum (10, 2)\r Click here to see the answer. It is OK, runs without error. The second return statement is not executed, but Python does not terminate due to a syntax error.\n 12: Is the following code OK (i.e., runs without error) ?\nvalue = mySum (10, 2)\rdef mySum (num1, num2):\rnum1 += 2\rnum2 += 5\rreturn num1 + num2\rnum1 += 10\rreturn num1 + num2\r Click here to see the answer. No, there is a syntax error in this program. The function was not defined before it was invoked. Always define the function before invoking it.\n 13: What does the following code print?\ndef myInteger (num1, num2):\rnum1 //= 5\rprint(num1)\rreturn num2 % num1\rnum1 = 15\rnum2 = myInteger(33, num1)\rprint (myInteger (num1 * num2, num2) )\rprint (num2)  Click here to see the answer. First, it prints 6, then 9, then 3, and finally 3.\n In-class Programming Exercises 1: Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers: num1 and num2. Then, the program invokes a function that takes two integers. This function returns true if the first number is greater than the second one, else it returns false. After the function returns the value, the program prints whether num1 is greater than num2, or not.\nClick to see the answer. # In-class Exercise 1\rdef myComparison (num1, num2):\rresult = False\rif num1 \u0026gt; num2:\rresult = True\rreturn result\rnum1 = int ( input ( \u0026quot;Please input an integer and press Enter\u0026quot;) )\rnum2 = int ( input ( \u0026quot;Please input an integer and press Enter\u0026quot;) )\rif myComparison (num1, num2):\rprint(\u0026quot;The first number is greater!\u0026quot;)\relse:\rprint(\u0026quot;The second number is greater or equal!\u0026quot;)\r  Answers to Programming Exercises  Please find the answers to programming exercises by clicking here.

While some platforms provide a single overall rating for product quality (also referred to as single-dimensional rating scheme), others provide a separate rating for each individual quality attribute (also referred to as multi-dimensional rating scheme). A multi-dimensional rating scheme is superior to a single-dimensional rating scheme, ceteris paribus, in reducing consumers' uncertainty about product quality and value.  However, we show that, when sellers respond to product ratings by adjusting their prices, compared to the single-dimensional rating scheme, the multi-dimensional rating scheme does not always benefit consumers, nor does it necessarily benefit the sellers or the society. The uncertainty associated with quality attribute rating and the extent of differentiation between competing products determine whether a finer-grained multi-dimensional rating scheme is superior to the coarser-grained single-dimensional rating scheme from the consumers', sellers' or a social planner's perspective. The main driver of the results is that the more (less) granular and less (more) uncertain information exposes (hides) underlying differentiation, or lack of it, between competing products, which, in turn, alters the upstream price competition in the presence of heterogeneous consumer preferences. The results demonstrate that focusing on the information transfer aspect of rating schemes provides only a partial understanding of the true impacts of rating schemes.","tags":null,"title":"Online Product Reviews: Is a Finer-Grained Rating Scheme Superior to a Coarser One?","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1634994000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634994000,"objectID":"cadc7befc3c9c9da1cfd4fccdf02d4e5","permalink":"https://muratmtunc.github.io/talk/impact-of-resale-royalty-on-primary-and-secondary-sale-prices-in-the-non-fungible-token-marketplace/","publishdate":"2021-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/impact-of-resale-royalty-on-primary-and-secondary-sale-prices-in-the-non-fungible-token-marketplace/","section":"event","summary":"Startups adopt non-fungible token (NFT) standard on Ethereum network and create marketplaces for collectible assets, trading cards and digital art.

Our estimations suggest that token creators benefit from NFTs with resale royalty only after they are sold on the secondary market numerous times.

Unlike the more prevalent unilateral review scheme in which only consumers rate providers, many sharing economy platforms use a bilateral review scheme in which both consumers and providers rate each other to reduce the information asymmetry on both sides of the market and to facilitate superior matches. However, we show that the bilateral review scheme does not necessarily lead to a higher social welfare than either the unilateral review scheme or the no review scheme.  If the proportion of the low-cost consumers is less than a threshold, consumers are better off, the platform is worse off, and the providers are worse off under the bilateral review scheme than the unilateral review scheme. The key driver for these results is that the price competition between providers for the low-cost consumers can be fundamentally different under the different review schemes; the price competition affects the consumer preference for a provider and hence the match between consumers and providers, which ultimately determines the payoffs to participants and the social welfare.
