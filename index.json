While some platforms provide a single overall rating for product quality (also referred to as single-dimensional rating scheme), others provide a separate rating for each individual quality attribute (also referred to as multi-dimensional rating scheme). A multi-dimensional rating scheme is superior to a single-dimensional rating scheme, ceteris paribus, in reducing consumers' uncertainty about product quality and value.  However, we show that, when sellers respond to product ratings by adjusting their prices, compared to the single-dimensional rating scheme, the multi-dimensional rating scheme does not always benefit consumers, nor does it necessarily benefit the sellers or the society. The uncertainty associated with quality attribute rating and the extent of differentiation between competing products determine whether a finer-grained multi-dimensional rating scheme is superior to the coarser-grained single-dimensional rating scheme from the consumers', sellers' or a social planner's perspective. The main driver of the results is that the more (less) granular and less (more) uncertain information exposes (hides) underlying differentiation, or lack of it, between competing products, which, in turn, alters the upstream price competition in the presence of heterogeneous consumer preferences. The results demonstrate that focusing on the information transfer aspect of rating schemes provides only a partial understanding of the true impacts of rating schemes.","tags":null,"title":"Online Product Reviews: Is a Finer-Grained Rating Scheme Superior to a Coarser One?","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1634994000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634994000,"objectID":"cadc7befc3c9c9da1cfd4fccdf02d4e5","permalink":"https://muratmtunc.github.io/talk/impact-of-resale-royalty-on-primary-and-secondary-sale-prices-in-the-non-fungible-token-marketplace/","publishdate":"2021-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/impact-of-resale-royalty-on-primary-and-secondary-sale-prices-in-the-non-fungible-token-marketplace/","section":"event","summary":"Startups adopt non-fungible token (NFT) standard on Ethereum network and create marketplaces for collectible assets, trading cards and digital art.

Unlike the more prevalent unilateral review scheme in which only consumers rate providers, many sharing economy platforms use a bilateral review scheme in which both consumers and providers rate each other to reduce the information asymmetry on both sides of the market and to facilitate superior matches. However, we show that the bilateral review scheme does not necessarily lead to a higher social welfare than either the unilateral review scheme or the no review scheme.  If the proportion of the low-cost consumers is less than a threshold, consumers are better off, the platform is worse off, and the providers are worse off under the bilateral review scheme than the unilateral review scheme. The key driver for these results is that the price competition between providers for the low-cost consumers can be fundamentally different under the different review schemes; the price competition affects the consumer preference for a provider and hence the match between consumers and providers, which ultimately determines the payoffs to participants and the social welfare. Our results highlight the importance of addressing the consumer-side adverse selection first to eliminate a market failure even in the sharing economy context. Our findings also contribute to the adverse selection literature by identifying the critical role played by demand and supply conditions on the impact of adverse selection.","tags":null,"title":"Two-Sided Adverse Selection and Bilateral Reviews in Sharing Economy","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

Unlike the more prevalent unilateral review scheme in which only consumers rate providers, many sharing economy platforms use a bilateral review scheme in which both consumers and providers rate each other to reduce the information asymmetry on both sides of the market and to facilitate superior matches. However, we show that the bilateral review scheme does not necessarily lead to a higher social welfare than either the unilateral review scheme or the no review scheme.  If the proportion of the low-cost consumers is less than a threshold, consumers are better off, the platform is worse off, and the providers are worse off under the bilateral review scheme than the unilateral review scheme. The key driver for these results is that the price competition between providers for the low-cost consumers can be fundamentally different under the different review schemes; the price competition affects the consumer preference for a provider and hence the match between consumers and providers, which ultimately determines the payoffs to participants and the social welfare. Our results highlight the importance of addressing the consumer-side adverse selection first to eliminate a market failure even in the sharing economy context.

While some platforms provide a single overall rating for product quality (also referred to as single-dimensional rating scheme), others provide a separate rating for each individual quality attribute (also referred to as multi-dimensional rating scheme). A multi-dimensional rating scheme is superior to a single-dimensional rating scheme, ceteris paribus, in reducing consumers' uncertainty about product quality and value.  However, we show that, when sellers respond to product ratings by adjusting their prices, compared to the single-dimensional rating scheme, the multi-dimensional rating scheme does not always benefit consumers, nor does it necessarily benefit the sellers or the society. The uncertainty associated with quality attribute rating and the extent of differentiation between competing products determine whether a finer-grained multi-dimensional rating scheme is superior to the coarser-grained single-dimensional rating scheme from the consumers', sellers' or a social planner's perspective. The main driver of the results is that the more (less) granular and less (more) uncertain information exposes (hides) underlying differentiation, or lack of it, between competing products, which, in turn, alters the upstream price competition in the presence of heterogeneous consumer preferences. The results demonstrate that focusing on the information transfer aspect of rating schemes provides only a partial understanding of the true impacts of rating schemes.","tags":[],"title":"Single-dimensional versus Multi-dimensional Online Ratings","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://muratmtunc.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":"","content":"\r\r\u0026lt;!—\nR Markdown\rThis is an R Markdown document.
